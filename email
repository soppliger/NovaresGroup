Hi,
All options are in working order. There are no structural or electrical pro=
blems. The interior is in nice condition. No mechanical issues at all. She s=
tarts easily and restart easily all the day. There aren't any service indica=
tors or warning lights on (meets description and pictures). All service reco=
rds and owner manuals are available. Clean and clear title, no liens (ready =
for a quick sale). Please check the link below to see the pictures, specific=
ations/description, a summary inspection report, etc.: https://www.capitalde=
potcenter.com/inventory/244305/=20
The boat can be seen at the local CDC warehouse (I suppose you know Capital=
 Depot Center).
I left it in their lot because we got a great deal on a different one (keep=
ing them both is not an option, have to pay for the other soon). Also due to=
 the COVID-19 pandemic I prefer to avoid personal meeting, therefore we have=
 signed a consignment agreement with these guys for its sale.=20
For inspection/pick up and payment, all you have to do is to contact CDC an=
d schedule an appointment. All their contact info are available on the websi=
te (phone numbers, live chat, office locations, etc.), in the contact us sec=
tion. Just provide them my name as seller when contacting them and they will=
 provide further assistance.
In case you want to have it shipped, as I have membership with CDC ( I=E2=80=99ve=
 bought through them before and I'm buying the new boat through them too), I=
 can ship up to 500 miles free of charge (over, extra fees will apply, $1.15=
 per mile).=20
If this option suits to your needs, then all you have to do, is to go on th=
e website to buyer registration page and request the purchase. Just fill out=
 the requested information on that page, and within a maximum of 24 hours, a=
n invoice regarding the purchase will be issued to you. The invoice should c=
ontain detailed information about the transaction, like insurance, shipping =
process, bill of sale, payment instructions, etc.. Basically all you need to=
 know about your purchase.=20
That's essentially the online buying process but I should also mention that=
, when purchasing, you get 7 day money back guarantee, which costs nothing a=
nd should give you the chance to decide on the boat, even before I get paid =
for it. The pre-delivery inspection will have an CDC representative on site =
who should answer your questions and show you everything works. The boat was=
 also pre-inspected before being listed for sale.
To end, the entire purchase process (payment options, shipping, guarantees,=
 return policy, etc.) is described on the website, on the how it works page.=
 Just read this page to better understand the process, I'm sure they do a be=
tter job explaining things than I do.
That's all for now, but if you have questions, I'll be more than happy to a=
ssist.
